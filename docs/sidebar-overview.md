# Right Sidebar Overview

This guide explains how the right sidebar is built.

The legacy `Sidebar` and `FloatingRevyAssistant` components have been removed in favor of a unified approach.

## ResizableRightSidebar

`ResizableRightSidebar` manages the width, collapsed state and visibility. The width is stored in `RightSidebarContext` so it persists between pages and can be resized by dragging the divider.

The sidebar now supports two views: an AI assistant and a team chat. The active view is chosen from header iconsâ€”robot for the AI assistant and users for team chat. Clicking an icon swaps the panel.

When the AI view is active the `AiRevyCard` component is rendered. It adapts based on the current route:

- `detectPageType` categorises the path as `admin`, `knowledge` or `general`.
- `extractClientId` checks the URL for a client identifier.
- These values are passed to `AiRevyCard` to adjust the assistant\'s prompt and context.

On mobile the card is shown inside a `Drawer` with its own header. On desktop it can be collapsed or hidden entirely.

`SmartReviAssistant` is embedded inside `AiRevyCard` and provides the chat interface used across the app. The team chat currently shows a placeholder component (`TeamChatPanel`) until further functionality is added. Any new sidebar features should extend this setup so the experience remains consistent.
